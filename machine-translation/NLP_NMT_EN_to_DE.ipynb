Implementing Machine Translation using LSTM models or any RNN models in general will not work effectively for long sentences due to vanishing gradient problem. To overcome this, we can add an attention mechanism to allow the model to access the relevant parts of the input sentence. We will see this in the discussions below. Let's get started!\n",

As mentioned in the lectures, this algorithm generates the translation by getting the most probable word at each step. It gets the argmax of the output array of your model and then returns that index. See the testing function and sample inputs below. You'll notice that the output will remain the same each time you run it."
