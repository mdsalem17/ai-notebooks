    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this notebook, we will be interested in building an English-to-German NMT model. In order to do so, we will use an Attention-based LSTM model. Implementing Machine Translation using LSTM models or any RNN models in general will not work effectively for long sentences due to vanishing gradient problem. To overcome this, we can add an attention mechanism to allow the model to access the relevant parts of the input sentence. We will see this in the discussions below. Let's get started!\n",
