In `T5_SQuAD_Model.ipynb` notebook, we are interested in building an context-based question answering model. In order to do so, we fine-tuned a pretrained T5 model on Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD).

Additionally, in `model-description.ipynb` notebook, we explore the model description and architecture. In `BERT_Loss_Model.ipynb`, we explore the decoding processing using BERT Loss model.

Library used: [Trax â€” Deep Learning with Clear Code and Speed](https://github.com/google/trax) library, maintained by Google Brain team.
