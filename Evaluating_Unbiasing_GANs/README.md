In this directory, we explore two techniques for evaluating GANs: Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) [`FID_Evaluation.ipynb`] and Perceptual Path Length (PPL) from StyleGAN2 [`PPL_Evaluation.ipynb`]. Additionally, in `Bias_in_GANs.ipynb` notebook, we explored a way to identify some biases of a GAN using a classifier.

Library used: - [PyTorch - Tensors and Dynamic neural networks in Python with strong GPU acceleration](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch).
