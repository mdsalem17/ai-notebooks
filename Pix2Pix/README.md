In `Pix2Pix.ipynb` notebook, we are interested in converting aerial satellite imagery into map routes. In order to do so, we use a Pix2Pix GAN model. Additionally, in `U_Net.ipynb` notebook, we explore the generator of Pix2Pix GAN that is a U-Net model. 

Library used: - [PyTorch - Tensors and Dynamic neural networks in Python with strong GPU acceleration](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch).
