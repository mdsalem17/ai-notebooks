In this directory, we explore different kind of GANs on MNIST dataset. We started by implementing a vanilla GAN in `VanillaGAN.ipynb` notebook. Next, we implemented a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) in the notebook `MNIST_DCGAN.ipynb`. Finally, we increased the stabilaty of the DCGAN by transforming it into a Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) in the notebook `MNIST_WGAN-GP.ipynb`

Additionally, in `model-description.ipynb` notebook, we explore the model description and architecture. In `BERT_Loss_Model.ipynb`, we explore the decoding processing using BERT Loss model.

Library used: - [PyTorch - Tensors and Dynamic neural networks in Python with strong GPU acceleration](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch).
