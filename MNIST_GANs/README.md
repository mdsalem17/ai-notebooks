In this directory, we explore different kind of GANs on MNIST dataset. We started by implementing a vanilla GAN in `VanillaGAN.ipynb` notebook. Next, we implemented a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) in the notebook `MNIST_DCGAN.ipynb`. Finally, we increased the stability of the DCGAN by transforming it into a Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) in the notebook `MNIST_WGAN-GP.ipynb`. Later on, we implemented a SNGAN to use a weight normalization technique to stabilize the training of the discriminator.
